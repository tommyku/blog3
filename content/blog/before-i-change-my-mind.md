Compared to my university days my blogging has slowed way down.

I simply don't know what to write here.

I shouldn't talk about my work. Not that I am in the liberty to talk much about my work, plus the content of my work is so boring there's nothing to really talk about anyways. Just you know normal investment bank programmer stuff.

In the past 3 years I had spent a lot of time writing about photography [*elsewhere*](https://photo.tommyku.com). It's an Internet hideout where more personal stuff are kept, things that don't seem "professional" enough to be kept here.

## Is this a Personal Website?

Come to think about it, it's interesting. This site was originally a dumping ground of my experiements during the university years and now somehow it's became part of my branding. A branding that should be professional and somewhat therefore impersonal.

Can't really call it personal website anymore. But it'll have to be, because that's how people understand me. When I introduce [TommyKu.com](https://tommyku.com) I will have to call it that. "Personal website", yet just a ted bit impersonal you know, like me wearing a suit in an interview. That's not me, just a particular image I wish others to see and hopefully attribute to myself in real life.

What about calling it a "Homepage"? Hmm, not cozy enough to call home. Now of course not all terminology and analogy needs to be translated from the real world.

But then there's no point continue to talk about this right if one can call the page whatever they like, ignoring the context how others would perceive it.

Let's just forget about all that and call [TommyKu.com](https://tommyku.com) my "Persoanl Website" and this blog my "Personal Blog". Make no mistake, it's no longer personal, and no longer anything I want to work on.

## What's Personal then?

Human is a social animal and I am identifying myself as a human still. I also have an urge to write about stuff and put them online so I feel good about myself.

I have a half-dead Instagram account that's not too difficult to find. That one is more personal, except Instagram owns it so it's more like, my social page? news page? status page? Whatever. I don't use it as much anymore. When I do nowadays it's because I feel really bored.

The point I am trying to make is that social media isn't really personal. I could have created a social media account and post my content there. Until one day their policy dictates that my content is undesirable and irreversibly erase them from Internet, without my consent. Or the company decided to shutdown the platform entirely, taking down years of work by the thousands. I also don't want my content displayed alongside ads. This site will serve no ads, forever, period.

On Web 2.0, everything a user generates is clustered into the same account. It is impossible control the audience of my work because everyone I know follows the same account of mine. Once something is posted, it's up to the mercy of the social media how, when, and who these content are exposed to. I may want to tell a joke that's funny to some of my friends but offensive to some others, I can't because some of them may see it and become upset. A lack of control limits my freedom.

Again my "Personal Website" exists to aid my job searching and networking, so any controversial (say my religious and political belief) or distracting content (say my camera collection) will have to live elsewhere. That's also why you don't see the link to my photography site on mobile. Serious people browse on a desktop screen.

## Anonymity

Being discrete is a good thing on the Internet. A massive social experiment once called Twitter has shown that the power of Internet bullying is more powerful than the bully living next door.

The best way to stay anonymous on the Internet is to get unplugged, go full offline. And that's probably going to far. One step back is use privacy software, public WiFi, VPN, Tor, host stuff on the dark web and pay for hosting in cryptocurrencies.

Ok maybe a few more steps back&mdash;a static page, on a sub-domain that's discoverable if someone really tries to dig deeper (say, via `whois` or search engine). Only those interested or those who I have told them about the site will be able to get there. Something like a&mdash;hideout.

## Not my Home, my Hideout

It's fine with people do whatever they want.

An escape, good enough for people to live in a dream world. In my hideout, I am free. I am not committed to anything. I have choices, that's the most important thing.

## What is this really about?

Oh wow you really read this?

Look, I have things I want to say and because of *many reasons* I can't say what I want. So imagine you're reading an SCP entry of my mind. The truth is between the lines and are actually redacted.

The full manifesto is in the basement.
