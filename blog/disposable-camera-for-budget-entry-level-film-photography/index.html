<p>Film photography—is it the forgotten art of the older generation? Most
people who have a mobile phone nowadays also have a digital camera in their
pocket, making film feel troublesome, inferior and obsolete.</p>

<p>I don’t think so that film photography is out of fashion. One of the most
popular app on smartphones is Instagram which allows for mimicking the look
and feel of a film photo by applying filters.</p>

<p>For those who are interested in film the old-fashioned way, I think the easiest
and cheapest mean to experience film photography is to buy a disposable camera,
also branded as “film with a lens”. To the manufacturers, they are selling you
a roll of film with a camera body that you can take photo without any up-front
investment.</p>

<p>I am going to share my experience of using disposable camera as a starting
point to film photography. Everyone’s journey is different and I don’t mean
to make this post a perscribed way of beginning film photography. I simply
hope disposable camera could open a door for you like it did for me.</p>

<p>Nowadays I shoot both digital (Fujifilm XT-20/OnePlus 7T) and film (Agfa
Solina/Reloaded Kodak FunSaver) photography.</p>

<h2 id="disposable-cameras-are-cheap">Disposable cameras are cheap</h2>

<p>There is a wide variety of disposable camera in the market: Fujifilm QuickSnap,
Kodak FunSaver and Ilford HP5 to name a few. They are cheap. you can easily get
one for less than HKD$100 (I got my QuickSnap for $85 and FunSaver for $90). If
the camera is priced over $100 try other shops. A $138 QuickSnap is absurd
(talking about you, LOG-ON).</p>

<h2 id="disposable-cameras-are-for-friends">Disposable cameras are for friends</h2>

<p>Disposable cameras are surprisingly popular. Searching on Instagram for
<code>#simpleace</code> or <code>#kodakfunsaver</code> yields over 10,000 posts for each tag.</p>

<p>Given its popularity, low price and ease of use, it is easy to invite a friend
to go shooting with you. Or you can just buy a brunch of them and distribute to
your friends when you guys are going out.</p>

<p>It will be a fun experience. You will discuss composition, lighting condition
and instructions written in Japanese that nobody really understands.</p>

<p>Instead of frustrating yourself by reading long online tutorial and articles
on how the aperture, shutter speed and ISO make up the exposure triangle, you
go out, point and shoot, and generally having a good time with friends. This
helps kickstarting a positive feedback loop for more film photography down
the line.</p>

<h2 id="disposable-camera-may-be-tricky-to-use">Disposable camera may be tricky to use</h2>

<p>With a low price tag, it is conceivable that the image quality you get out of
the plastic disposable camera lens is inferior to coated glass lens of a
rangefinder/SLR camera. However you can reasoanbly expect to at least recognize
whatever you are trying to take photo of, sometimes even amazed by the outcome.</p>

<h3 id="comparing-disposable-camera-with-smartphone-camera">Comparing disposable camera with smartphone camera</h3>

<p>What makes disposable cameras tricky to use is it’s fixed aperture size (how
much light goes through the lens), shutter speed (how long a film is exposed to
light) and focal length (angle of view in the resultant photo). To better
illustrate this find below two photos taken under the same lighting condition
using a Kodak FunSaver and a OnePlus 7T respectively.</p>

<p>If I were to take the film photo again, I would have used a faster shutter
speed and smaller focal length so it preserves that grainy, slightly
color-shifted film feel while not looking so washed out due to overexposure.
The problem is that you have no such choice with disposable camera. Everything
is fixed: ISO 800 light sensitivity, f/11 aperture, 1/100 shutter speed, 30mm
focal length.</p>

<p>Disposable cameras are designed for the inexperienced, so the manufacturer
tend not to add any configurability that confuses the users. Plus this design
drives the cost down as there are less moving parts.</p>

<h3 id="disposable-cameras-are-designed-for-simplicity-thus-tricky">Disposable cameras are designed for simplicity, thus tricky</h3>

<p>With disposable camera you have two choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What to include in the shot</li>
  <li>Whether to take the shot or not</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything else has been taken care of. You don’t need to fiddle with camera
setting or have any knowledge in the technical know-how, just point at your
subject and press the shutter. Disposable camerais configured to a sweet-spot
that shots taken by a layperson would look OK under most conditions. They may
look a bit bright/dark, but rarely totally disastrous.</p>

<p>Even for a severely underexposed shot like below (indoor without flash), I
still managed to get a photo with all intended subjects still visible and
recognizable.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might just hit the sweet spot where the camera setting
preconfigured in your disposable camera <em>happens to be</em> the perfect camera
setting for the scene like below. Unfortunately, I didn’t take a light meter
reading to tell whether this scene is actually <em>perfect</em> for a Kodak FunSaver,
but judging by the high saturation, properly preserved highlight &amp; shadow
details and that everything is in focus, I believe this shot hits fairly close
to the sweet spot.</p>

<p>After getting some terribly underexposed shots using a QuickSnap Simple Ace, I
ended up creating a “preview” of how the shot would look like given the light
condition. My OnePlus 7T comes with a pro mode where I can set the ISO and
shutter speed given a fixed aperture.</p>

<p>Using some online calculator I calculated the explosure value (EV) of my 
FunSaver. After that I created a ISO-shutter speed combination on my phone to
obtain the same EV on my OnePlus 7T. Essentially, given the same scene both
camera will yield the same exposure result.</p>

<p>Initially, I mistook the specification of a FunSaver so my calculation came

be</p>

<p>Therefore, when I thought a photo is properly exposed through my OnePlus 7T,
the image is actually overexposed on the FunSaver. Most photos I took in the
same roll were overexposed.</p>

<p>With experience you could more or less guess whether the lighting condition
at the moment is suitable for your disposable camera, and you may be off by
a stop or two. Don’t worry, there’s a chance to fix it afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="remedies-to-overunderexposure">Remedies to over/underexposure</h3>

<p>Not all scene would have the perfect lighting condition, or something happens
so quickly that you have no time to meter/preview the scene properly beforehand:
at that moment you had to just press the shutter, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>And most of the time you’ll end up with over/underexposed photos. With
disposable camera you actually have <s>two</s> three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What to include in the shot</li>
  <li>Whether to take the shot or not</li>
  <li><strong>How to improve the shot in post-processing</strong></li>

<p>If the original film shot isn’t giving you the feel/color that you like, you may
edit the photo digitally after scanning the film. However, your mileage may vary
because unlike a digital photo RAW file, film contains limited information and
not all the information was digitized when you scanned the film.</p>

<p>Lost shadow or lost highlight are forever lost despite you may salvage them to
a certain degree until color banding or some other unpleasant effects starts
happening (you may observe some color banding near to the sun in the above
image).</p>

<h2 id="disposable-camera-is-single-useright">Disposable camera is single-use…right?</h2>

<p>The general advice for developing the films in a disposable camera is
give the whole thing to the lab where the film is developed. This is not
because the process of taking the film out requires any expertise, but that
the lab can send the camera body back for the manufacturer to reuse the parts.</p>

<p>Seriously, <a href="https://youtu.be/OhCdPCyG7x4?t=24">you can do it with anything having a long, sharp edge</a>.</p>

  </a>
<figcaption>Considering that I once used a table knife to pop this cap in a restaurant, anyone can do the same</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After taking out the film roll, you are left with a “film-less” camera body.
You can use it as a prop for your next photoshoot, or reload it to give it
another go. The manufacturer is doing exactly that, so there must be a way
for you to do the same.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Disposable camera are single-use for most people because they ar designed to be
troublesome and difficult to reuse for those who don’t care enough.</p>

<p>In normal film cameras, films are unrolled one by one from the film canister as photos are taken, and rewinded back into the canister at the end of the roll.
Throughout the entire process the film is protected in complete darkness inside
the camera body, except for the brief moment when the shutter is open for a
glimpse of light to burn the scene onto the film.</p>

<p>On a disposable camera, however, films are first unrolled out of the canister,
then as you take the photos they are rolled back into the canister. After using
up the whole roll, you don’t need to rewind, just take the canister out for 
development.</p>

<p>If you casually open up a disposable camera and begin unrolling the
film out of the canister in a attempt to “reload” the camear, you’re simplely 
exposing every bit of the film to external light before any of your picture is
taken, and you’ll end up with a blank roll. Unlike conventional film camera, 
disposable camera must be reloaded in the dark.</p>

<p>Manufacturer designed disposable cameras this way knowing not many people would
go through this trouble to reuse camera. They also brand them as “disposable”,
“single-use” so people are willing to come back to buy another camera. Remember,
your lab sends the camera body back to manufacturer for recycling, so you’re
playing their game that’s rigged to their advantage in the first place.</p>

<p>And thus I searched online how to reload a disposable camera. Luckily
there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7rfWtm5R5s">detailed tutorial on YouTube by David Allen</a>.
I did exactly that.</p>

<figcaption>A reloaded Kodak FunSaver can be used the same way as before</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Reloading film may be risky and dangerous. Accidental light leak ruins the
entire roll if you take the camera out of the dark before it is properly sealed.
You may break the film in the middle of loading. You may also get electric shock
from the capacitor that powers the flash light. Remember to discharge it first 
by taking a shot with the flash after opening the camera body (you can turn the 
internal gear to prime for a shot even without any film).</p>

<p>While I don’t recommend this, you can also get a Lomography Simple Use that can
be reloaded like a normal camera in the light, thus avoiding the said trouble.
Well then…how is it disposable and single-use?</p>

<h2 id="disposable-cameras-accept-different-films">Disposable cameras accept different films</h2>

<p>Even though you’ll have no control over the exposure triangle once the film is
loaded onto a disposable camera, there are surprisingly many things you could
experiment with just using a disposable camera.</p>

<p>It was a necessity for me to reload my Kodak FunSaver with different film
because originally it comes with a ISO 800 film, which is more expensive and
harder to come by than say, a Kodak UltraMax 400 or Kodak ColorPlus 200.</p>

<p>However, how can you possible load a film with different ISO? Will the shots
be exposed properly and generate acceptable result?</p>

<p>Film is surprisingly tolerant to over/underexposure. Consider the box ISO speed
a suggested speed. You can shoot a film marked ISO 400 at ISO 800 and still
get decent though underexposed result.</p>

<p>When you shoot a ISO 400 (less sensitive) film at ISO 800 setting, you are
assuming the film is more sensitive that it really is and thus underexposing
the film. To remedy this, when developing the film you tell the lab people
to “push” the film by “1 stop”. The film strip will remain in the chemical bath
for a longer time during development to lighten the image, increase contrast
and introduce more grains.</p>

<p>See below for photos taken before and after reloading. UltraMax 400 performs
well when pushed to ISO 800, showing that pushing by a stop doesn’t drastically
degrade the image quality of the film.</p>

</figure>

<p>Regardless of the technical jargon of “push/pulling” by “n stop”, the key is that
you <em>can</em> use film at different speed to reload your disposable camera. With such
a cheap camera you can try out black and white or different kinds of film until
you have decided invest in better gears.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/03/14/spent-year-refilling-disposable-cameras-premium-film/">there is at least one other person who does this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="disposable-cameras-are-portable">Disposable cameras are portable</h2>

<p>Disposable cameras are light and compact compared to SLR and rangefinder due to
it’s small and embedded front element.</p>

<p>An SLR or rangefinder aren’t as rectangular as a disposable and requires an
extra bag to carry them around safely. With a disposable I simply slide it into
my back pocket or the side pocket of my backpack wherever I go.</p>

<p>Extra caution is required to keep those vintage lenses clean and free from scratches
too, while you can cheaply replace an entire disposable camera should the lens
be scratched or become dirty.</p>

<p>You get the similar benefits from an automatic point-and-shoot film camera, but
