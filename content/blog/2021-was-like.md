## In short tips

Some recurring themes this year are self-empowerment, assertiveness and letting go.

> Time spent in fixing mistakes is time wasted. When you could have spent less time avoiding the mistake in the first place. Take controlled risk. &mdash; Somewhere online

> I have the tendency to hoard for backup so I have the option when the primary one fails (buy the same camera/headphones) but that means I'm foregoing a better future for a comfortable present. &mdash; Probably Me

> Life never runs out of waves to shake you. But while it isn't easy, you do learn to surf better. &mdash; [charlie_wonka on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/charlie_wonka/), probably

> Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison. &mdash; Probably Reddit

> If you can move on and not care about them, it is good for your personal development. Your life is about you. Life without mistakes isn’t life, but a fairy tale. &mdash; Maybe me?

> Fuck-ups happen. Some people make it their mission in life to make sure that whenever a fuck-up happens, somebody will suffer. Don't be that person, and don't let that person get to you. They're an ass. &mdash; Probably Reddit

> Spend time avoiding mistakes, not fixing them. &mdash; Probably Me

> You don't have to be young to feel young. &mdash; Probably Me

> 擅自期待，又因期望落空而擅自嬲怒，實在難看。 &mdash; Probably Me

> 他说，很多时候人们从同一点出发，有人会勉强自己做一些事，有了第一次还有第二次；而有人一开始就别扭，坚持初心，有了第一次，也会有第二次，时间一长，必然越走越远。 &mdash; 京都古书店风景
