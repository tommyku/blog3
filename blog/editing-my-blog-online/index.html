<p>Since my blog was first created and even after multiple revamps, there is no
online-editing capability, until today as I am writing this post on the web.
The solution is surprisingly simple that I couldn’t believe why I haven’t done
this earlier.</p>

<p>I use a static site generator called <a href="https://nanoc.ws/">Nanoc</a> to convert
posts written in markdown into HTML. One property of a static site generator
is that I cannot edit my blog online unlike CMS such as WordPress, I couldn’t
edit my blog online.</p>

<p>After an infrastructure change, I am now able to logon to a file editor on
PC or mobile and see immediately the change I made on a clone of my blog in
DEV environment.</p>

<h2 id="before">Before</h2>

</figure>

<p>Before this infrastructure change has been made, I needed to</p>

<p>In order to make any change blog content, I have to open
the posts, written markdown, using text editor, save it, and push it to GitHub
such that the CI can compile and deploy the updated pages.</p>

<p>There is no need to change any of the existing flow. The issue that troubles
me so far has only been the part where I cannot edit online. Being a lazy, I
don’t want to migrate my blog to a headless CMS either — that’ll be an
overkill and I don’t like my data being tied to one specific platform.</p>

<p>Therefore, I cloned the existing setup and added online content editing,
hopefully together they work as planned.</p>

<h2 id="after">After</h2>

</figure>

<p>The Dev server I have been using came with Nanoc. Nanoc itself doesn’t listen
to file change unless you couple it with Guard, which has been bundled into
the release of Nanoc I am running on.</p>

<p>Basically, I run <code>nanoc live</code> and it recompiles the diff every time I save a
file. The site sits behind a Nginx reverse proxy with basic auth
<a href="../hide-docker-containers-behind-nginx-proxy/">just like how I did for many things else</a>.</p>

<p>I spent a hour searching online for something I can just easily hook onto a
folder so that I can edit the folder content on a web page, ideally with Docker.
So far, only <a href="https://filebrowser.xyz/">File Browser</a> fits the bill, and man it
looks and works great.</p>

<p>Isn’t this super obvious? I was surprised when I wrote this setup down on paper,
wondering why haven’t I figured it out earlier, and even wasting an afternoon
looking at some headless CMS offerings.</p>

<p>The purpose of running my own server and a few web services is so that I can learn
to be lazy. And with this zero-migration setup, lazy I am.</p>
